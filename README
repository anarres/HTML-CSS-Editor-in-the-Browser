Extremely simple HTML and CSS templating system

Allows for the creation of HTML/CSS website templates where certain values
(e.g. title, background color, ...) can be configured by a user with no 
coding knowledge.

It's pure javascript and thus browser-only, with no server-side component.

It's new and buggy and doesn't exactly work yet.
